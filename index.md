##  Description/Goals 
This 13-week course aims to introduce students in the Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences MSc & PhD  programmes with foundational knowledge of principles applied in the growing fields of Computational and Systems Biology, following a practical, problem-solving approach. 

This course is *practice-driven* and aims to:
- Build **computational thinking** for biologists
- Introduce **fundamental biological questions** which can be addressed via computation for non-biologists
- Develop skills for enabling the creation of **reproducible analysis pipelines/software tools** in Python
- Connect algorithms with **real biological questions**
- Prepare students to independently analyze different types of biological data (e.g. sequence, omics and structural biology data)


This course is **taught in English** and is available to ERASMUS+/YUFE students.

**Weekly structure:**  
- 3h (i.e. 2 × 1.5) lecture-style ***practical*** sessions  
- 1 × 1h tutorial / hands-on / troubleshooting session  
**Environment:** Google Colab (Python, Jupyter notebooks)  
**Main (programming) textbook:** *Python Programming for Biology: Bioinformatics and Beyond* (Stevens & Boucher; ISBN: 9780521720090), avaialble through the UCY library from this [link]([https://www.cambridge.org/cy/universitypress/subjects/life-sciences/genomics-bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/python-programming-biology-bioinformatics-and-beyond?format=PB#resources](https://www.cambridge.org/cy/universitypress/subjects/life-sciences/genomics-bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/python-programming-biology-bioinformatics-and-beyond)).

## Course philosophy

Each topic includes:
- Short conceptual intro
- Live coding / guided notebooks
- Structured exercises
- Open-ended extensions
- Course assessment is continuous and aims at ensuring all students gradually build the skill-set necessary for being able to apply the material handled in class in real-life settings (e.g., research or work environments), thus critical thinking and application of good practices are important (not mere memorization!!).
